# Trying out Krustlet

This is my work-in-progress repo where I'm trying out [Krustlet](https://docs.krustlet.dev/).

## How to run

Install [Task](https://taskfile.dev), then `task build` should build the wasm binary and `task deploy` _would_ deploy it, except it doesn't quite work yet. Something with connecting Krustlet to the Kind cluster.
